<h1>The Goal</h1>

Teams of robots have to transport semi-finished products from machine to
machine in order to produce some final product according to some production
plan. Machines can break down, products may have inferior quality,additional
important orders come in and need to be machined at ahigher priority.  Due to
increasing demands for flexibility production facilities will become dynamic
environments, where shop floor layoutsand the number, location and type of the
engaged machinery change constantly. The robots therefore need to be able to
identify these machines either visually or by direct communication. For the
LLSF, a team consisting of up to three robots starts in the game area of about
5.6m x 5.6m.
