A number of semi-finished products is represented by RFID-tagged
<i>pucks</i>. Each is in a particular state, from raw material through
intermediate steps to being a final product. The state cannot be read by the
robot but must be tracked and communicated among the robots of a team. On the
playing field are <i>machines</i>, RFID devices with a signal light indicating
their processing status. When placed on a proper machine type, a puck changes
its state according to the machine specification which is communicated via
broadcast messages. The outcome and machine state is indicated by particular
light signals.
