<BODY>

During the game a number of different semi-finished products
need to be produced with ten machines on the playing field. Orders are posted
to the robots requesting particular final products to be delivered to specific
delivery gates and in specified time slots. All teams use the same robot base,
a Festo Robotino which may be equipped with additional sensor devices and
computing power, but only within certain limits.
